Hi, there! I’m a software engineer, Harvard alumnus, and lifelong learner. In my blog, I write about all things technology that I find interesting.

I’m always open to project/research collaborations, or just connecting with others passionate about software, so feel free to reach out (<ryandlindeborg@gmail.com>)!
