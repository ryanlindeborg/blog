Hi, there! I’m a software engineer, Harvard alumnus, and lifelong learner. In my blog, I write about all things technology that I find interesting.

I love open-source. Some projects I have contributed to are <a href="https://github.com/lebrice/Sequoia">Sequoia</a> (continual learning research framework), <a href="https://github.com/great-expectations/great_expectations">Great Expectations</a> (data validation and profiling), and <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast">Hazelcast</a> (distributed in-memory data grid).

I’m always open to project/research collaborations, or just connecting with others passionate about software, so feel free to reach out (<ryandlindeborg@gmail.com>)!
